# Encounter 3.1 - A Deal with the Devil

Run this encounter when Kalarel meets the party for the second time. You should have been keeping a tally of every PC's kill count up to this point. Kalarel sees the party as an opportunity to obtain new bodies.

After the party has killed some people around Murgo Gold, read

    You hear a deep inhale-like sound and look around to find Kalarel the Vile floating before you with a small group of undead minions. The undead scramble over to the bodies that you have just killed.

If the people the party jsut killed are ones with Murgo Gold, he takes it from them, otherwise he takes it out of his pocket. He then floats over to whoever has the highest kill count.

    "You seem to leave a trail of death in your wake. Take this as a token of my respect, and a hope for further dealings in the future." He then reaches out and gives you a handful of blood-red gold pieces. You flinch a little holding them, as they are ice-cold to the touch. "I hope to see you again soon."

If the party try to attack him, he casts uses his staff to teleport back to the Black Tower. Read:

    "No, we musn't fight, you have far too much work to do." Then a void of black energy wraps around him and his cohorts, and they vanish, with the same sound that they arrived with.

So long as the players are in possesion of the Murgo Gold, Kalarel senses any death that happens within 500 ft. of them and can teleport to the bodies to take them back to the Black Tower.
