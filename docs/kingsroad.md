# Chapter 1 - On the Kings Road

    You feel somewhat relieved as you go into the fourth and final day of your journey along the King's Road. You began this journey worried about the danger of long travel, but have found yourselves somewhat disappointed by the lack of excitement.

If any players succeed a DC 15 Wisdom (perception) check, read them the following:

    As you look out around the woods that stand on either side of the road, you start to notice some rustling in the trees. You see a small, scaled, creature dash from one tree to another, seemingly moving toward your position.

Whether or not they succeed, read this:

    You hear a thud as a crossbow bolt sinks into the side of one of your horses, wounding it. Five kobolds emerge from the surrounding trees. Roll initiative!

If a PC succeeded on the perception check, then the Kobolds do not get a surprise round.  
Run [Encounter 1.1](koboldattack.md)

If the PCs attempt to follow the Kobolds to their lair, if any player succeeds a DC 10 Wisdom (survival) check, then run [The Delian Tomb](deliantomb.md).

Whether or not the players go to the Delian Tomb, they should finish their journey to Winterhaven after their encounters, at which point they reach level 2.
