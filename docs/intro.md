# Intro

## The Villain

Kalarel the Vile, Psion of Orcus is a Death Cleric of Orcus who is trying to summon Orcus to the Prime Material Plane. Although (unbeknownst to him) he is nowhere near powerful enough to summon Orcus, if he is successful, Orcus will send Lord Soth, the Death Knight, as a sign of his approval. In order to achieve this goal, Kalarel grows his stronghold, the Black Tower, by feeding dead bodies to it. His two main sources of bodies are his Blood Gold and a goblin tribe into which he has placed one of his lieutenants, Balgron the Fat. Once the Black Tower has grown to its needed power, Kalarel will reopen a portal to the Shadowfell where he (incorrectly) believes Orcus has gone to.

## Adventure Synopsis

On the King's Road, roughly a half day's travel to Winterhaven, the heroes are ambushed by a troop of kobolds. If the heroes chase any fleeing kobolds, they will eventually come across the kobold's lair where they will find a White Dragon Wyrmling on a leash from a kobold with a tattoo of a ram's skull. Once they arrive at Winterhaven, they will get into a fight with some thugs, which is when they'll meet Kalarel the Vile, who will display his power, then take the bodies of the dead thugs back to the Black Tower. THe adventurers will then have the chance to explore the area around Winterhaven, where they will find many foes, and possibly some allies for their final confrontation with Kalarel.
