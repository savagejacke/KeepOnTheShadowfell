# Dragon Excavation

In the mountains around Winterhaven. The lair of a long-gone dragon has been found buried in the mountains. It is unknown what happened to the dragon, but much of its hoard is still buried in the mountain. Nobody has learned anything about the identity of the dragon that once inhabitted this lair, but it was an Adult Red Dragon who left as he discovered that the portal to the Shadowfell that is now within the Black Tower was transforming it into a Shadow Dragon. The lava river that flows through Winterhaven is a result of the changes to the landscape caused by the dragon's lair. The dragon has been gone long enough that it is the only feature remaining, and it only remains because of the townsfolk's prayers to Hiem.

## The Excavation

The excavation is run by foreman Kern Bronzefoot, a grim dwarf with grey hair and beard who has accepted Murgo Gold from Kalarel. Kern has been rigging cave-ins to kill people who Kalarel can then take back to the Black Tower. This allows for much cheaper labor, because Kern doesn't need to pay dead people. Despite putting on a strong front, Kern is somewhat cowardly, so he won't directly confront the PCs unless he has reason to believe that they will starve him of his constant labor flow. The excavation has gotten somewhat deep, but, due to the constant cave-ins, progress has been slow. When the party gets to the excavation, they are almost at a major breakthrough that could lead to some insight into the nature of the lair.

## Arrival

When the players arrive at the excavation, read

    Very soon after passing the tree line, you see smoke billowing from a cave, that you can only assume is the excavation. Another half hour of hiking later, and you've reached the entrance to the excavation. A Goliath guard, armed with a large warhammer walks up to you. "You new meat sent to the mine?"

If the PCs don't make a fuss, he takes them to see Kern. The Goliath introduces himself as Vagak.

    Vagak leads you into the mine, then shows you to a room that seems to have been dug into a wall in the cave. Walking in, you can't help but be impressed with how well this office was carved out of the stone of the mountain. Sitting at a coal-black stone desk is a tired-looking dwarf, with a greying black beard covering most of his face.  
    "So, you seem strong enough. I'm Kern, the foreman of this operation. I assume you're here for work. I'll pay you 5 gold per day, assuming you spend the entire day digging, and you can keep 10% of the value of any treasure you find."

The payment that Kern gives is non-negotiable, if the PCs try, he says "We've no shortage of work, take it or someone else will." The party are provided with pickaxes and sent into the mine.

## At the Digsite

If it seems like the players intend on spending multiple days at the excavation allow them to do so and award them treasure based on Strength (athletics) checks that they roll. The PCs are provided with a tent to sleeep in for every two party members. If they stay for a while, they may notice some shifty activity as Kern and some of his underlings rig a tunnel to collapse. At some point before the party leaves. You can also run Orcs Attack while they are at the site. At some point run Cave-In.

## Cave-In

Have the players roll Strength (athletics) checks, and read the following to whoeve rolls the highest:

    After a few hours of mining, you finds something new. A large dragon scale, the scale is red, but black shadow seems to seep down the scale from the base a bit.

As this player examines the dragon scale, read the following to whoever rolls the worst.

    The sound of your pickaxe agaisnt stone seems to reverberate a bit more than it has been in your time mining. Then one hit causes it to break apart, showing a large cave ahead. A few moments later you hear a large BOOM from behind you. All of you turn around to see stones falling from the top of yor mineshaft. It's caving in! What do you do?

The party is now in a skill challenge. They must succeed on 5 skill checks before they fail 3 to succeed. For every failure, the PC attempting the check takes some amount of bludgeoning damage, and one of the 3 people they were working with is killed.  
As they manage to escape, Kern and his undrlings are there to help get anyone who is clearly going to survive out of the wreckage, and clearing out the cave-in to get to any bodies. Roll a Dexterity (sleight of hand) check for Kern, and anyone with a passive perception exceeding his roll notices him pocketing something. If their score is 5 or more above his roll, they recognize the Murgo Gold.  
If anyone was killed, Kalarel shows up. Read this to the party:

    From seemingly out of nowhere. You see a familiar man, clad in deep purple, floating up to the cave-in. Kalarel floats to Vagak, who you now see carrying the bodies of the workers who were killed. He says, "Once again, you have something for me," and he drops one piece of blood-red gold into the goliath's hand, who passes the bodies off to a group of goblins.

If the players have received any Murgo Gold, whether or not they have disposed of it, Kalarel approaches the PC who he gave the cursed coins to. Read:

    Kalarel then floats over to you, as you tend to your bruises. He lands gently and puts a cold hand on your shoulder "We seem to run into each other quite often. It's always a pleasure to see the face of a friend." He pats your cheek, and, with a smile, floats off toward his goblin cohorts.

If noone was killed, read:

    With a surprised look, Kern runs over to your group. "I see you all are unharmed for the most part. A most welcome surprise! I hope that this does not dampen your enthusiasm for working with us."

If any player succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (insight) check, then they notice that Kern is somewhat dissapointed about something. Kern is willing to pay anyone who survives a cave-in a small bonus if they choose to stay. If they don't choose to stay, he sends Vagak after them who goes to Winterhaven, and fights the party if he finds them, or is assured that they aren't spreading any rumors if he can't find them in the town.

## Orcs Attack

If the party spend much time at the excavation, you can run this encounter to pass the time. A group of Orcs attack the digsite. This allows the party to get into a scrap to pass the time, and show that Vagak could be a threat.

## Return

If the party returns to the digsite after their cave-in. The cave-in has blocked the tunnel they were working on, so they're assigned to a different mine that doesn't lead directly into the dragon's lair. At some point, a [Gallows Speaker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gallows-speaker) floats through a wall and attacks the party. Anyone who has researched undead can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence (religion) check to recall how a Gallows Speaker is created.
