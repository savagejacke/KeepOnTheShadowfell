# Chapter 3 - The Middlegame

This section should be the most expansive part of the adventure. The players should be at least level 4 (prefferably level 5) before they advance to the Black Tower.

In this part of the adventure, the party has the opportunity to explore the area around Winterhaven, so that they can learn about what Kalarel has been doing and what they can do to help.

You should keep count of each player's kill tally so that for use in Encounter 3.1.

## Things that can happen

- The PCs can explore the excavation of a long dead [dragon's lair](excavation.md)
- Kill Kalarel's top lieutenant, Balgron the Fat (the bugbear in the [goblin lair](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop/goblin-arrows#CragmawHideout) in the Lost Mine of Phandelver)
- Kalarel sends a lieutenant (deathlock) after the party if they start getting rid of Murgo Gold
- A shadow has killed a family of farmers and they will raise as shadows at dusk

## Things that should happen

- The second time that the party encounter Kalarel, run [Encounter 3.1](murgodeal.md)
