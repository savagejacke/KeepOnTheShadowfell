# Encounter 1.1 - Kobold Attack

## Enemies

- 1 [Kobold Dragonshield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kobold-dragonshield) (cold resistance)
- 2 [Kobolds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kobold)
- 2 [Winged Kobolds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/winged-kobold)

## Encounter Description

The kobolds on the ground attempt to use pack tactics to improve their chances to hit while the flying kobolds attack from range. Once two kobolds or the dragonshield go down, the remaining kobolds flee towards their lair in the woods.

This encounter should not be too challenging, meant to either give the characters a taste of their power, or to lead them toward the kobold's lair [(The Delian Tomb)](deliantomb.md). The characters recover whatever weapons the kobolds were carrying as well as 3 gp, 14 sp, and 8 cp.
