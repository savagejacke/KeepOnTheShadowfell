# The Winter's Hold

The Winter's Hold is the inn in Winterhaven. The bartender, Audric, accepted the Murgo Gold and hates adventurers because they kill people and bring Kalarel to his inn. The barmaid, Bella, works for Kalarel and tries to get people to fight over her in hopes that they will create bodies for the Black Tower.

## People in the inn

- 2 groups of ~3 townsfolk
- 4 unsavory people in the corner with leather armor and weapons
- Audric
- Bella

When the players approach Audric:

    The barkeep has thick black mutton chops and greasy black hair, as you approach he seems terrified. He keeps looking down, not making eye contact.

If the players ask for food:

    "We have no rooms, plenty of food and drinks; it's on the house, but no rooms. Please don't get in a fight, please don't kill anyone."

The people in the corner approach whoever makes sense and say something that will start a fight (figure out with character creation). When they do, run [Encounter 2.1](barfight.md)
