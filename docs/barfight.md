# Encounter 2.1 - Bar Fight

A few ruffians start a fight with the players. They fight to the death. This brings Kalarel the Vile to the Winter's Hold to collect the bodies.

## Combatants

- 3 [bandits](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/bandit)
- [Corrin Delmaco](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1095308-corrin-delmaco)

Corrin takes the lead, but the bandits aren't afraid of the fight. They fight to the death.

The players should be able to dispatch the ruffians pretty easily. Audric immediately rushes over to the players:

    The barkeep rushes over to you. "I told you not to start a fight. I told you not to kill anyone. Why didn't you listen to me?"

Almost immediately afterward, 4 goblins rush in alongside Kalarel:

    The door bursts open, in rush four goblins. Behind them, floating into the room as if the mere act of walking is beneath him comes a man, clad in deep purple robes with scarlett accents and with the skull of a ram engulfing his head. He floats to the barkeep. "As per our usual agreement." Shaking, as if compelled to do so against his will, reaches out his hand. Into the barkeep's palm, the man drops a handful of deep, blood red gold pieces. The goblin minions pick up the corpses and carry them out of the building. "You are as good as your word. A pleasure doing business with you again, my friend."

If the players try to fight Kalarel, he will cast a third-level [thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave) spell at all but one of the party members, leaving them for dead (the other player and the townsfolk can heal them). If they won't stop attacking, he will kill the one player he left conscious then leaves. If asked, the people in the inn can tell the players that the man was Kalarel the Vile and that he has been reigning over the town for months.

Once the players have met Kalarel, they level up to level 3.
