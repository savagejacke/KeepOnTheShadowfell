# The Delian Tomb

The PCs have followed a kobold scout party back to their lair in the Delian Tomb. The Delian Tomb is the resting ground for the Order of the Delian Knights, a long dead order of knights dedicated to the protection of law above all else.

## Sections on the map

1. The adventurers first come across this set of doors. They are fake doors and anyone who opens one must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or take 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
2. These doors lead into the tomb. Outside the tomb is a scout of 4 [kobolds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kobold) who are hidden. If the adventurers succeed a DC 10 Wisdom (perception) check, then they spot the kobolds. If the players enter the tomb without killing these kobolds, they arrive from behind in the second round of combat in room 3.
3. On one wall is a relief of the Delian Knights fighting the forces of chaos. On the other side is the oath of the Delian Knights. In the room is a brazier where admirers used to leave offerings to the fallen knights. Also in the room are 5 [kobolds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kobold).
    **The Delian Oath**  
    *I, Sextus Varius, swear the Delian Oath*  
    *To serve law, battle chaos, and keep the Delian Lore secret*
4. There is a pressure plate trap on the floor. It can be noticed with a DC 15 Wisdom (perception) check and disarmed with a DC 10 Dexterity check with Thieve's Tools. When a medium character steps on the plate, it releases a scythe. The character must succeed on a DC 10 DEX save or take 1d10 slashing damage.
5. In this room are a [white dragon wyrmling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/white-dragon-wyrmling) on a leash held by Kraxus, a white [winged kobold dragonshield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/kobold-dragonshield). The statue in the back is a statue of Sextus Varius on a dias. On the steps of the dias reads the riddle: *If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me.* If a character speaks the answer (Giving the Delian Oath), a secret door in the back corner opens to room 6. The door can also be found with a DC 15 Intelligence (investigation) check. Kraxus has a tattoo of a ram skull across his chest.
6. This room contains the tomb of Sextus Varius and the rest of the original Delian Knights. Upon Varius's sarcophagus is his weapon (a [+1 longsword](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/longsword-1) with a dragon's head on its hilt).

## Kraxus, Ice Lord

Kraxus is the leader of the kobold troop that took over the Delian Tomb. He has made a deal with Kalarel to allow him to stay in the tomb without issue. Kraxus gives bodies to Kalarel at regular intervals. This allows the kobolds to keep some bodies to feed themselves and their dragon and allows Kalarel to not waste time fetching bodies every time they kill someone.
