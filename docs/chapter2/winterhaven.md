# Chapter 2 - Winterhaven

Winterhaven is a small walled town at the base of the mountains that has become popular as a haven against the winter (hence the name). It is so popular because a magical lava river of unknown origin flows through the center of the town, keeping it unusually warm.

The players should spend a lot of time in Winterhaven in later chapters, so refer back to this chapter when you need to know anything about Winterhaven.

## Entering the town

    As you manage to get to the top of the hill you reach the arch that allows entry into the walls of the town of Winterhaven. There is no gate, only the hinges on which it once stood. "Why do you come travelers?" You hear shouted from someone above on the wall.

The guard allows the players in as long as the players don't say something really stupid that would make them not want to.

## Lord Silas Taylor II

Lord Silas Taylor II is the Lord of Winterhaven. He was very well loved until the coming of Kalarel. The day Kalarel arrived in Winterhaven, Silas' son and heir Silas III took sick and soonafter died. Since then Lord Taylor has been far too terrified for the health of his wife Eris and his remaining infant son, Wardric to raise any resistance to Kalarel's reign of tower. Much of Kalarel's power in Winterhaven is derived from the lack of resistance from lord Taylor. After Silas III's death, Lord Taylor began praying to Orcus in secret out of fear that He sent the sickness that killed Silas III, although he has not forsaken his worship of the Matron of Snow. The only way that Silas could be conviced to stand against Kalarel is if he could be if he believed that doing so would protect his family more than Kalrel and Orcus could.
