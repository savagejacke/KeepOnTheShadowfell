# The Matron's Embrace

The Matron's Embrace is the temple in Winterhaven. It is dedicated to the Matron of Snow. It is currently closed because Kalarel suppresses the worship of anyone other than Orcus.

## Haius

Haius is the priestess who maintains the Matron's Embrace. She is immensly popular among the townspeople. When Kalarel arrived and initially tried to shut down the temple, she refused until he tortured her and threatened to burn the entire town. He realized however, that if he killed her, the entire town would rise against him, which he was not strong enough to repel yet.  
If the PCs wanted to raise the town agaisnt Kalarel, they would almost certainly need to convince Haius to lead them. If Kalarel is ever in such dire straits that he needs to destroy the town, he would start by killing Haius and parading her body throughout the town.  
Although the temple is shut down, Haius secretly blesses families and serves as the town's leader, as Lord Taylor is too afraid of Kalarel to lead the people.

## Erasmus

Erasmus was the most devoted follower of the Matron before Kalarel's coming, but his faith came from her ability to overpower the winter, so when Kalarel seemed to become the most powerful person his his world, he converted to the worship of Orcus. As one of the priests in the Matron's Embrace, he spies on Haius in service of Kalarel.
