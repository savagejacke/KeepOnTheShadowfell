# Blacksmith

The town blacksmith is a dwarf named [Bijaz Ferrus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2356144-bijaz-ferrus) who wears a long black beard in a braid down his chest.

Kalarel has forced him to stop almost all his work, which has left him struggling. Kalarel relys mostly on adventurers to provide him with bodies, so he sees most weapon production as merely a way for the people to rise up against him. Bijaz is now only able to craft tools meant to help the effort at the [excavation](excavation.md).

Bijaz would has locked himself in his home and only comes out once a week to drink at the Winter's Hold. The PCs would have to break into his house or meet him there in order to speak with him. He would be initially hesistant to work with the party, for fear of retribution from Kalarel, but he is open to being convinced to help them, less disposed, however, if they break into his home.
