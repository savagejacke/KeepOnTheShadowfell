# Dragon Excavation

In the mountains around Winterhaven. The lair of a long-gone dragon has been found buried in the mountains. It is unknown what happened to the dragon, but much of its hoard is still buried in the mountain. Nobody has learned anything about the identity of the dragon that once inhabitted this lair, but it was an Adult Red Dragon who left as he discovered that the portal to the Shadowfell that is now within the Black Tower was transforming it into a Shadow Dragon. The lava river that flows through Winterhaven is a result of the changes to the landscape caused by the dragon's lair. The dragon has been gone long enough that it is the only feature remaining, and it only remains because of the townsfolk's prayers to Hiem.

## The Excavation

The excavation is run by foreman Kern Bronzefoot, a grim dwarf with grey hair and beard who has accepted Murgo Gold from Kalarel. Kern has been rigging cave-ins to kill people who Kalarel can then take back to the Black Tower. This allows for much cheaper labor, because Kern doesn't need to pay dead people. Despite putting on a strong front, Kern is somewhat cowardly, so he won't directly confront the PCs unless he has reason to believe that they will starve him of his constant labor flow. The excavation has gotten somewhat deep, but, due to the constant cave-ins, progress has been slow. When the party gets to the excavation, they are almost at a major breakthrough that could lead to some insight into the nature of the lair.

## Arrival

When the players arrive at the excavation, read

    Very soon after passing the tree line, you see smoke billowing from a cave, that you can only assume is the excavation. Another half hour of hiking later, and you've reached the entrance to the excavation. A Goliath guard, armed with a large warhammer walks up to you. "You new meat sent to the mine?"

If the PCs don't make a fuss, he takes them to see Kern. The Goliath introduces himself as Vagak.

    Vagak leads you into the mine, then shows you to a room that seems to have been dug into a wall in the cave. Walking in, you can't help but be impressed with how well this office was carved out of the stone of the mountain. Sitting at a coal-black stone desk is a tired-looking dwarf, with a greying black beard covering most of his face.  
    "So, you seem strong enough. I'm Kern, the foreman of this operation. I assume you're here for work. I'll pay you 5 gold per day, assuming you spend the entire day digging, and you can keep 10% of the value of any treasure you find."

The payment that Kern gives is non-negotiable, if the PCs try, he says "We've no shortage of work, take it or someone else will." The party are provided with pickaxes and sent into the mine.

## Mining

If it seems like the players intend on spending multiple days at the excavation allow them to do so and award them treasure based on Strength (athletics) checks that they roll. If they stay for a while, they may notice some shifty activity as Kern and some of his underlings rig a tunnel to collapse. At some point before the party leaves. run the following encounter:

Have the players roll Strength (athletics) checks, and read the following to whoeve rolls the highest:

    After a few hours of mining, you finds something new. A large dragon scale, the scale is red, but black shadow seems to seep down the scale from the base a bit.

As this player examines the dragon scale, read the following to whoever rolls the worst.

    The sound of your pickaxe agaisnt stone seems to reverberate a bit more than it has been in your time mining. Then one hit causes it to break apart, showing a large cave ahead. A few moments later you hear a large BOOM from behind you. All of you turn around to see stones falling from the top of yor mineshaft. It's caving in! What do you do?

The party is now in a skill challenge. They must succeed on 5 skill checks before they fail 3 to succeed. If they never fail, they manage to excape unscathed, and all of the other 3 people in who they were mining with
